UCLA Game Lab Mesh Creator

Create simple meshes from image textures. Add a MeshCreatorData component to an empty game object and select options. Use "Update Mesh" button in the inspector to generate mesh.

See the unity for example, or import the package in MeshCreator.01 to an existing project.

Major Issues:
- The primitive fill algorithm is super slow, I'm sure there are some nice optimizations that will make life easier.
- Option for sprite type textures is needed, maybe just by adding a plane instead of creating a mesh.
