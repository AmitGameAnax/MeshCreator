# Mesh Creator 0.7

Create meshes from alpha image textures in Unity. Mesh Creator has editor scripts that use the alpha channel in textures to build a mesh and colliders in your scene. This allows simple creation of art assets without the need for external 3d software.

Major release packages are kept here in the MeshCreator.Packages directory. Those packages may not be compatible with files in the rest of this repo.

The MeshCreatorOverview pdf included here gives a brief overview of some features of this tool.
